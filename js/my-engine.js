/* EN: my-engine.js is based on the engine.js provided by Udacity.
 * My comments (Ekaterina Nikonova) begin with 'EN'.
 * Major changes:
 * - function drawCanvas() is added for building canvas that fits all viewports
 * - ctx.scale() is used in the render() function to make elements match
 * the dimensions of the canvas
 * - background is rendered using the renderBackground() function that
 * chooses random columns to replace their top blocks with water and updates
 * the water pattern according to the value of waterLife
 * - added global vars to be used in app.js (ratio, level, dt, waterBlocks)
 * - canvasSplash is added to display levels, score, remaining lives etc.
 * on top of the game screen
 * - levelUpdate() function is added to track the current level and level-ups

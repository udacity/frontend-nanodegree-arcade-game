"""
Easy YAML serialisation compatible with TAP format.

Port of `Data::YAML Perl module <https://github.com/AndyA/Data--YAML>`,
satisfying all its tests, intended to be used for support of
`TAP <http://testanything.org/>` data format. Port of the original
documentation follows.

The syntax accepted by this module is a subset of `YAML <http://yaml.org>`.

===========
YAML syntax
===========

Although YAML appears to be a simple language, the entire YAML
specification is huge. This module implements a small subset of the
complete syntax trading completeness for compactness and simplicity.
This restricted syntax is known (to me at least) as 'YAMLish'.

These examples demonstrates the full range of supported syntax.

All YAML documents must begin with '---' and end with a line
containing '...'.

::

    --- Simple scalar
    ...

Unprintable characters are represented using standard escapes in double
quoted strings.

::

    --- "\\t\\x01\\x02\\n"
    ...

Array and hashes are represented thusly

::

    ---
      - "This"
      - "is"
      - "an"
      - "array"
    ...

    ---
      This: is
      a: hash
    ...

Structures may nest arbitrarily

::

    ---
      -
        name: 'Hash one'
        value: 1
      -
        name: 'Hash two'
        value: 2
    ...

Undef is a tilde

::

    --- ~
    ...

====
Uses
====

This module may be used any time you need to freeze and thaw Python
data structures into a human readable format. The output from
`yamlish.dump()` should be readable by any YAML parser.

The original Perl module was originally written to allow machine-readable
diagnostic information to be passed from test scripts to
the Perl module `TAP::Harness`. That means that if you're writing
a testing system that needs to output TAP version 13 or later
syntax you might find this module useful.

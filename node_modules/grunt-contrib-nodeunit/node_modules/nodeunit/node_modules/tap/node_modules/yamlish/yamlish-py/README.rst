YAMLish is a small subset of YAML that TAP producers may use to
embed machine readable information in TAP diagnostics. See TAP
diagnostic syntax for information about how YAMLish embeds in
TAP.

Based on Data-YAML version 0.0.6

but it is so thoroughly rewritten that I don't consider it
derived work and I don't feel the need to resolve what "This
library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the same terms as Perl itself." actually means.

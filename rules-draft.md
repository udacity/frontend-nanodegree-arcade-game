# Rules and characters

1. Different levels
2. There are grass blocks (different color?) on the other side. They should be reached to get a bonus. The number of grass blocks decreases from level to level. Water resets the game with the loss of life.
3. There are several types of enemies (change color on canvas). The weakest ones cause damage (reduce life), but don't kill you. The strongest ones move faster.
4. Rocks make stone blocks unavailable for some time.
5. When the game is reset, the character flickers.
6. Gems give points. A certain level of points gives a level-up + healing.
7. Hearts give additional lives.
8. A key makes the character invincible for some time.
9. A splash when the character reaches the other side.
10. A splash after a level-up.
11. Animation when the character 'dies'. (becomes transparent?)

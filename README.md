Hello! My name is Paulo Freitas Nobrega and this is my version of Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game of Udacity. You can access the rubric of the game at this link: (https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric).

#### Game History
In my version of the game the main character has his town invaded by insects. Your goal avoid insects. But stay tuned! You do not know how to swim, so avoid the water. Perhaps you did not like that idea. Do not worry, I developed a faithful version the rubric of the project. You can get it on this link:

#### How to Play?
As I mentioned, you should divert the insects avoiding falling into the water. When an insect finishes his route, crosses the entire display, a standard amount of points (10 potos) are added to your score. When you reach a new level the game difficulty increases. This is because the speed of insects is proportional to the level of the game. Since the level rises, the insects receive an additional of speed.

When your character is hit by an insect, one of their lives is taken. By the way , you start the game with a default amount of lives (3 lives). If you lose your lives, the game comes to an end. But do not worry, sporadically some bonus appear on the scene. If you rescue them you'll earn scores and extra lives.

The game has no end. Your goal is to exceed their own limits. Beat your record, or the record of his friends, and show that you are a true champion. Good Game!

#### Installation


Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

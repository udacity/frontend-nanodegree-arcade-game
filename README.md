# FROGGER GAME v2.0

This is the coolest minigame all the time! Seriously ;).


## How to Play

To run the game, please open index.html or visit [my github page](https://gel00.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)!

## Goal

With a selected character, you have to collect all the gems and key, while you have to avoid bugs on the map.
After that you can leave the level by crossing the bridge.

## Bugs

Bugs have 3 different speed; slow, normal, fast. The more gems you have collected, the more bugs you have to eschew.
Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.

## Gems

There are 4 different gems and 1 key, that you must collect to win.

## Control

The player can move left, right, up and down by pressing the navigation keys.

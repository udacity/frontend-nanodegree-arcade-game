#Frogger Arcade Game

This game is very similar to the classis Frogger arcade game. This project is part of the Front-End Nanodegree Course at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

##Goal of the Game

The aim of the game is that the character at the bottom has to reach the water without colliding with the bugs that are running accross the screen.

##Controls

The player can move the character with the help of the arrows on the keyboard.

##Levels

As the game progresses more and more Enemies will appear as the form of bugs on the screen. It will get harder for the player to reach the next level.

##Installation

1. Clone the project or download the GitHub zip file to your local environment from [here](https://github.com/tomka88/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

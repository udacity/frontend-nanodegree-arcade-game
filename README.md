#FROGGER ARCADE GAME

##1. About
This is a take on the classic arcade game Frogger. It was completed as part of the Udacity FrontEnd Nanodegree requiring HTML, CSS, JS and Canvas. The image resource management and a basic loop engine was provided prior to starting the project.

##2. Run

1. Download the zip file
2. Extract it into a folder
3. Run the file index.html

Note: Verified compatibility in Chrome

##3. How to play

Use the arrow keys to get across the water (for 20 points) whilst avoiding the evil bugs that can hurt you. The bugs move faster every time you cross successfully.

You can get an extra 10 points for every sparkley gem you collect. You only have 90 seconds per game. Spacebar will pause the game. Esc gets you back to the main menu.

Good Luck!

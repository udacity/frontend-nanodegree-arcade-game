# Froggernator
===============================

<h2>Welcome to Froggernator!</h2>
<p>This is my second project out of the Front-End Developer course through Udacity. I was tasked with recreating the classic top down (or in this case down top) strategy game Frogger Revamped!</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>I'm glad you asked! The basic rendering and animation functionality is found in the [engine](engine.js) file. In a nutshell, the canvas is updating at 1000.0 delta ticks per second which creates the illusion that the game is moving in smooth transitions.</p>

## The Pocket-Sized Pest Quest ##

### Introduction ###

This is a little game, based on Frogger, in which a petite character attempts
to make it across the stone path without getting hit by the bug enemies. Points
are also gained by collecting stars.

### Why I Made This Game ###

This project is an assignment for the [Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program from
Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). It uses Object-oriented functions: class functions and class prototype
functions.

### How to Run This Game ##
Open the index.html file in a browser.

### How to Play ###

1. Use the keyboard arrow keys to move your player up, down, left and right.
2. Try to avoid the bugs. If the player collides with one, 1 point is lost.
3. Collect stars for 2 more points each.
4. You can change players at any time by pressing:
  - **p** for princess
  - **b** for boy
  - **c** for cat
4. Once the player reaches the water, congratulations! 5 more points earned.
5. Try to cross again. Each time, the bugs get quicker.
6. Press the reset button to completely start over.

the enemies moving across the screen to the right.

When you begin the game, you will have two options for gameplay.  Press 1 if
you would like to play the easy version.  In the easy version, the enemies move
within a constant range of speeds. Press 2 for the more difficult option,
in which the enemy speeds increase with each point you score.

If you lose the game, you will be given the change to play the game again, and
choose a new difficulty level, if you desire.  Likewise, When you win the game,
you will be able to play again and choose a difficulty.

Enjoy!

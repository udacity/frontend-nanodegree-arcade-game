How to play the Game:
In this game, you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. Just use your arrow key on the keyboard to move the player in these directions. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy; the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water, the game is won.

The goal was to develop a game with at least the following functionality:

For this project I:

- Downloaded the art assets and provided the game engine.
- Reviewed the code and comments provided in app.js
- Identified the various classes I needed to write.
- Identified and coded the properties each class must have to accomplish its tasks.
- Wrote the functions that provide functionality to each of the class instances.
- Added features: i) choose your character, ii) choose your enemy, iii) choose if music is played or not
- I also added additional styles through the CSS file 

 

The repository contains the following files: 

- style.css
- images
- sounds
- js folder
- index.html 
- README.md file. 


I also used the following resources to learn and write the code:

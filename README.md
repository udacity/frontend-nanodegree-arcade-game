This is Udacity arcade-game project from Frontend-nanodegree. Starter code was taken from [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/).

How to play the game:
There is a player which can move with the arrows: up, down, right, left. To win you need to collect at least five gems and reach the water. In the beginning you have three lives. When you hit the bug, you lose one life.
